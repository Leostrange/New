# 🐛 Fix CBZ/CBR crashes and PDF navigation issues

## 📋 Summary

This PR resolves critical issues with comic file reading functionality:
- **CBZ/CBR files** causing app crashes 
- **PDF files** showing only cover page without navigation
- **Routing issues** directing to mock implementation instead of real readers

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

**Main Issue**: `MainActivity.kt` was using `MrComicNavigation` which routed to a **simulation/mock** of comic reading instead of the actual file readers from `feature-reader` module.

The app had two different reader implementations:
1. ✅ **Real readers** in `feature-reader` module (CBZ/CBR/PDF support)
2. ❌ **Mock readers** in `app/ui/screens` (test data only)

The app was routing to #2 instead of #1, causing all file reading issues.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. **Critical Navigation Fix**
- **File**: `android/app/src/main/java/com/example/mrcomic/MainActivity.kt`
- **Change**: Replaced `MrComicNavigation` with `AppNavHost`
- **Impact**: Now routes to real `feature-reader` module instead of mock implementation

```kotlin
// BEFORE:
MrComicNavigation(analyticsHelper, performanceProfiler)

// AFTER:  
AppNavHost(navController, onOnboardingComplete = {})
```

### 2. **Enhanced CBZ Reader**
- **File**: `android/feature-reader/src/main/java/com/example/feature/reader/data/CbzReader.kt`
- **Improvements**:
  - ✅ Comprehensive error handling
  - ✅ Encrypted file detection
  - ✅ Proper resource cleanup
  - ✅ Support for additional formats (webp, bmp)
  - ✅ Detailed logging for debugging

### 3. **Enhanced CBR Reader**
- **File**: `android/feature-reader/src/main/java/com/example/feature/reader/data/CbrReader.kt`
- **Improvements**:
  - ✅ RAR archive handling
  - ✅ Corrupted file detection
  - ✅ Temporary file cleanup
  - ✅ Graceful error handling

### 4. **Enhanced PDF Reader**
- **File**: `android/feature-reader/src/main/java/com/example/feature/reader/data/PdfReader.kt`
- **Improvements**:
  - ✅ Fixed page navigation
  - ✅ Large page scaling (max 2048px)
  - ✅ Better memory management
  - ✅ Proper resource cleanup

### 5. **Enhanced ReaderViewModel**
- **File**: `android/feature-reader/src/main/java/com/example/feature/reader/ui/ReaderViewModel.kt`
- **Improvements**:
  - ✅ Detailed logging for debugging
  - ✅ Better navigation handling
  - ✅ Page state tracking

### 6. **Enhanced Supporting Components**
- **CachingBookReader**: Better cache management and error handling
- **BookReaderFactory**: Improved file format detection with logging
- **ReaderScreen**: Fixed method call from `loadComic` to `openBook`

## 🧪 Testing

### Before Testing:
All these functionalities were broken:
- ❌ CBZ files crashed the app
- ❌ CBR files crashed the app  
- ❌ PDF files showed only cover, no navigation
- ❌ Progress bar worked but pages didn't change

### After Testing Should Show:
- ✅ CBZ files open and display all pages
- ✅ CBR files extract and show content
- ✅ PDF files navigate between pages correctly
- ✅ Touch navigation works (left/right taps)
- ✅ Progress bar matches actual page navigation

### Test Files Recommended:
- Small CBZ file (< 10MB)
- Small CBR file (< 10MB)  
- Multi-page PDF (3+ pages)
- Large files to test memory management

## 📱 Debugging Logs

### Success Logs to Look For:
```
D/ReaderViewModel: Opening book: [URI]
D/BookReaderFactory: Creating [FORMAT] reader
D/[Format]Reader: Successfully opened [FORMAT] with X pages
D/ReaderViewModel: Page X loaded successfully (WIDTHxHEIGHT)
```

### Error Logs to Watch For:
```
E/[Format]Reader: Failed to open [FORMAT] file: [error]
W/[Format]Reader: Failed to decode bitmap from: [path]
E/ReaderViewModel: Failed to open book
```

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### For Developers:
- No breaking API changes
- Navigation routing changed (internal)
- All existing features preserved
- Additional error handling added

### For Users:
- Should see immediate improvement in file reading
- Better error messages for unsupported files
- Improved performance for large files
