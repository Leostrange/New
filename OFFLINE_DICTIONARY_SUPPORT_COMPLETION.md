# Mr.Comic - Offline Dictionary Support Completion

## Overview
This document summarizes the completion of the offline dictionary support functionality for the Mr.Comic application's OCR module.

## Task Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - Offline dictionary support for OCR module has been fully implemented

## Features Implemented

### 1. Dictionary Storage and Retrieval
- Local storage system for dictionary files
- Support for JSON-formatted dictionary files
- Automatic loading of dictionaries from assets and local storage
- Custom dictionary management (import, export, delete)

### 2. Dictionary Management UI
- Import functionality with file picker
- Export functionality for dictionary backup
- Delete functionality for dictionary removal
- Dictionary selection interface
- Refresh mechanism to reload dictionaries

### 3. Translation Service Enhancements
- Support for multiple dictionary types:
  - English-Russian translation dictionary
  - Japanese-Russian translation dictionary
  - Manga sound effects dictionary
  - OCR post-processing corrections
  - General text pre-processing
- Custom dictionary loading from local storage
- Dictionary quality scoring system
- Fallback mechanisms for missing translations

### 4. Repository Layer
- LocalResourcesRepository with full CRUD operations for dictionaries
- File I/O operations for dictionary import/export
- URI handling for file operations
- Error handling and validation

### 5. Integration Points
- Settings screen integration with dictionary management
- OfflineTranslationService with dictionary operations
- ViewModel coordination for UI updates
- Automatic refresh when dictionaries are modified

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture
- Clean separation of concerns between UI, ViewModel, and Repository layers
- Dependency injection with Hilt for all components
- Coroutines for asynchronous file operations
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### Data Models
- LocalDictionary model with ID, name, languages, version, and path
- Support for metadata in dictionary files
- UUID-based identification for dictionaries

### File Management
