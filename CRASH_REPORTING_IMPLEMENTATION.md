# Crash Reporting Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of comprehensive crash reporting for the Mr.Comic application. The crash reporting system captures uncaught exceptions, logs them, saves them to files, and sends them to the analytics system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Crash Capture
- Implemented `CrashReportingService` for handling uncaught exceptions
- Set up default uncaught exception handler to capture all crashes
- Added detailed crash information logging including stack traces
- Implemented crash information saving to files for potential recovery

### 2. Analytics Integration
- Integrated crash reporting with existing analytics system
- Created `AnalyticsEvent.Error` event type for tracking crashes
- Implemented automatic crash event tracking when crashes occur
- Added manual error reporting method for caught exceptions

### 3. Error Handling Improvements
- Added proper error handling for crash processing operations
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for crash reporting failures
- Added logging for all crash reporting operations

## Technical Details

### Crash Reporting Service
The `CrashReportingService` provides the following functionality:

1. **Initialization**: Sets up the uncaught exception handler
2. **Crash Tracking**: Automatically tracks crashes as analytics events
3. **File Storage**: Saves crash information to files for potential recovery
4. **Manual Reporting**: Allows manual reporting of caught exceptions

### Integration Points
- Integrated into `MainActivity` through dependency injection
- Automatically initialized during app startup
- Works with existing `AnalyticsTracker` implementation

### Data Captured
When a crash occurs, the system captures:
- Exception type and message
- Complete stack trace
- Timestamp of the crash
- Thread information

## Files Modified/Added

### Existing Files
1. `CrashReportingService.kt` - Enhanced with comprehensive crash reporting
2. `MainActivity.kt` - Already had crash reporting service integration

## Testing
The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- Uncaught exceptions are properly captured
- Crash events are sent to the analytics system
- Crash information is saved to files
- Manual error reporting works correctly
- Error handling is robust and doesn't cause additional crashes

## Future Improvements
- Add crash report sending to remote servers
- Implement crash report viewing in the analytics dashboard
- Add user notification for crashes with options to send reports
- Implement automatic crash report submission with user consent
- Add crash grouping and deduplication
