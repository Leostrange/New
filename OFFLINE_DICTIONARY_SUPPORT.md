# Offline Dictionary Support Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of enhanced offline dictionary support for the Mr.Comic OCR and translation module. The system now supports multiple dictionary files and improved text processing capabilities.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Dictionary Loading
- Modified `OfflineTranslationService` to load all available dictionary files from assets
- Added support for multiple dictionary types:
  - English-Russian dictionary (`en-ru.json`)
  - Japanese-Russian dictionary (`ja-ru.json`)
  - Manga sound effects dictionary (`manga-sfx.json`)
  - OCR post-processing dictionary (`post.json`)
  - OCR corrections dictionary (`ocr_corrections.json`)
  - Additional dictionaries (`post_processing.json`, `pre_processing.json`, `glossary.json`)

### 2. Improved Text Processing
- Added pre-processing functionality to prepare text before translation
- Enhanced OCR post-processing to fix common recognition errors
- Implemented manga sound effect detection and translation
- Added word-by-word translation for better accuracy with phrases

### 3. Language Detection
- Enhanced language detection capabilities
- Added support for detecting multiple languages including Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Korean, Hebrew, and Arabic
- Improved accuracy of language detection algorithms

### 4. Translation Quality Metrics
- Added functionality to calculate translation quality scores
- Implemented dictionary coverage analysis
- Added methods to get available dictionary information

## Technical Details

### Dictionary Loading Process
The `OfflineTranslationService` now loads multiple dictionary files during initialization:

1. Main translation dictionaries (en-ru, ja-ru)
2. Manga-specific dictionaries (sound effects)
3. OCR processing dictionaries (post-processing, corrections)
4. Additional dictionaries (pre-processing, glossary)

### Text Processing Pipeline
1. **Pre-processing**: Prepare text for translation using pre-processing dictionaries
2. **OCR Post-processing**: Fix common OCR errors using correction dictionaries
3. **Language Detection**: Automatically detect source language if not provided
4. **Translation**: Apply appropriate translation strategy based on languages
5. **Special Handling**: Special processing for manga sound effects

### Supported Languages
The system now supports translation between multiple language pairs:
- English ↔ Russian
- Japanese ↔ Russian
- Chinese, Korean, Hebrew, Arabic detection and basic support

## Files Modified

### Modified Files
1. `OfflineTranslationService.kt` - Enhanced with comprehensive dictionary support

## Testing
The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- All dictionary files are properly loaded from assets
- Text processing pipeline works correctly
- Language detection is accurate
- Translation quality is improved
- Error handling works properly with fallback mechanisms

## Future Improvements
- Add more dictionary files for additional language pairs
- Implement dictionary updating mechanism
- Add user-defined custom dictionaries
- Improve translation algorithms for better accuracy
- Add support for more languages
- Implement dictionary compression for smaller app size
