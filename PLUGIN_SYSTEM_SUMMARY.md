# Plugin System Implementation Summary

## Overview
The plugin system for Mr.Comic has been successfully implemented, providing a secure and extensible way to add functionality to the application. The system supports JavaScript plugins with a sandboxed execution environment and a comprehensive permission model.

## Core Components

### 1. PluginManager
- Manages the lifecycle of plugins (activation, deactivation)
- Handles plugin metadata extraction
- Coordinates plugin execution through the sandbox
- Manages plugin dependencies

### 2. PluginSandbox
- Provides isolated execution environment for JavaScript plugins
- Prevents plugins from accessing sensitive system APIs
- Exposes a controlled API for plugin interactions

### 3. PluginApi
- Defines the interface for plugin-to-application interactions
- Provides secure access to application functionality based on permissions
- Supports logging, data storage, UI modifications, and notifications

### 4. PluginValidator
- Validates plugin packages for security and integrity
- Checks file sizes, extensions, and content
- Prevents execution of potentially harmful code

### 5. PluginPermissionManager
- Manages plugin permissions and access control
- Handles permission requests and grants
- Ensures plugins only access approved functionality

### 6. PluginRepository
- Handles plugin persistence in the database
- Manages plugin installation, uninstallation, and updates
- Coordinates with PluginManager for activation/deactivation

## Security Features
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Permission-based access control
- Code validation and security scanning
- File system isolation
- Network access restrictions

## Plugin Types Supported
1. **JavaScript Plugins** - Executed in WebView sandbox
2. **Native Plugins** - (Planned) Android native code plugins
3. **Hybrid Plugins** - Combination of JavaScript and native functionality

## Example Plugin
A "Hello World" example plugin has been created to demonstrate the system capabilities:
- Event handling (comic opened)
- UI element creation (button)
- Notifications
- Data storage
- Logging

## API Capabilities
Plugins can:
- Register for application events
- Show notifications to users
- Add UI elements to the interface
- Store and retrieve data
- Log messages
- Access comic and page information (with permissions)
- Execute approved system commands

## Future Enhancements
- Native plugin support
- Plugin marketplace
- Advanced plugin configuration UI
- Plugin performance monitoring
- Enhanced security features

## Testing
Unit tests have been created for the PluginRepository to verify core functionality:
- Plugin installation with validation
- Error handling for invalid plugins
- Plugin activation/deactivation
- Plugin uninstallation

The plugin system is now ready for use and provides a solid foundation for extending Mr.Comic functionality.
