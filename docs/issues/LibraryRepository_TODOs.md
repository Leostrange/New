# Issue: Implement LibraryRepository TODO functions

The file `feature-library/src/main/java/com/example/feature/library/LibraryRepository.kt` contains several TODO placeholders for functionality that has not yet been implemented:

- Lines 43-45: `importComicFromUri` – importing comics from a URI
- Lines 46-48: `addBookmark` – adding a bookmark to a comic
- Lines 49-51: `removeBookmark` – removing a bookmark
- Lines 52-54: `getBookmarks` – retrieving a comic's bookmarks

These methods currently contain placeholder comments and return empty results. Implementing these will require:

1. Extending the `ComicDao` with the necessary queries (e.g., insert/select/delete for bookmarks, reading history, etc.).
2. Handling file imports from the Android `Uri` API and saving comic metadata.
3. Creating database entities for bookmarks if they do not already exist within this module.
4. Updating `RoomLibraryRepository` to interact with the new DAO methods.

Until these features are implemented, bookmark functionality and importing comics will not be available within the `feature-library` module.
