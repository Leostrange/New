		<h3>Hide one or more comic series from my kids</h3>
		<p>There are two ways you can protect you Comic collection from unwanted access.
			<ul>
				<li>Password Protecting ComiCat: By setting an app password you can protect your entire comic collection. Password can be set from "General Settings"</li>
				<li>Using Private Folders: You can selectively choose to mark certain folders as private. Private folders and their comics can only be seen by entering the password.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3>Keep the zoom fixed while reading a comic</h3>
		<p>Sometimes it is very desirable to have a fixed zoom level for the entire comic, fortunately one of our user suggested this feature and we implemented it.
			<ol>
				<li>Open the Comic</li>
				<li>Pinch to zoom to select the desired zoom level</li>
				<li>Pan the page by dragging to set the starting position for all subsequent pages</li>
				<li>Bring up the menu and select the icon with four inward arrows to lock zoom and page position.</li>
				<li>Continue enjoying your comics.</li>
			</ol>		
		</p>
		<h3>White borders around my comic are taking a lot of screen space</h3>
		<p>There are two ways in ComiCat to fix it
			<ul>
				<li>In the "Viewer settings" you can select, "Crop Comic Page Margins" to automatically crop the white borders from all the pages while displaying them.</li>
				<li>While reading the comic, set the zoom level and position so that white borders are off screen. Now you can select "Set frame" option (the icon has four arrows pointing inwards) from the menu/action bar to lock the zoom level and position. All forthcoming pages during that reading session will be displayed with the same zoom level and position.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h3>My comic collection is spread across multiple sd cards and USB drives</h3>
		<p>
			You can use the "Retain Deleted Comic Data" feature. This is a setting in "Catalog Setting", by default it is off, you can turn it on. Now, when you remove a SD card and insert another the resync will as usual add new comics from that SD card and will remove the ones from the one that was removed. But it will not delete the comic data, thumbnails, etc. So when the SD card is re-inserted the sync will be very fast and reading history, bookmarks, hidden state of comics will be maintained.
		</p>
		<h3>Remove a folder from my bookshelf without deleting</h3>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>In "Catalog Settings", select "Group Comics by Folders".</li>
				<li>Go to catalog and locate the folder you want to remove.</li>
				<li>Tap and hold to bring up the context menu.</li>
				<li>Select "Exclude Folder From Catalog"</li>
			</ol>
			<span>
				If you ever wish to re-add the folder to catalog you can do so by going to "Catalog Settings" and removing the folder from the list of "Exclusions". You would need to re-sync after that.  
			</span>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Select the files that I want to download.</h3>
		<p>
			In the "Cloud Sync Settings" turn on "Enqueue Comic As Paused". Next time you do Cloud Sync all the new comics will be added to your download queue but as paused. You can start the desired ones from "Active Downloads". You can also set the priority for the comics you want first or choose to ignore a file so that it is never downloaded. 
		</p>
		
		<h3>Read the entire series as a single comic</h3>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>In "Catalog Settings", select "Group Comics by Folders".</li>
				<li>Go to catalog and locate the folder that contains your series.</li>
				<li>Tap and hold to bring up the context menu.</li>
				<li>Select "Start Reading"</li>
			</ol>
