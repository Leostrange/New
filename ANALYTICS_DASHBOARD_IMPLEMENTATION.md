# Analytics Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the analytics dashboard feature for the Mr.Comic application. The analytics dashboard allows users to view usage statistics, performance metrics, and recent app events.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Analytics Storage System
- Created `AnalyticsStorage` interface for persistent storage of analytics events
- Implemented `RoomAnalyticsStorage` using Room database for local event storage
- Added `AnalyticsEventEntity` Room entity for database storage
- Created `AnalyticsEventDao` for database operations
- Implemented `AnalyticsDatabase` with proper Room setup

### 2. Enhanced Analytics Tracking
- Modified `LocalAnalyticsTracker` to store events in the local database
- Events are now persisted for later retrieval in the analytics dashboard
- Maintained existing Logcat logging functionality

### 3. Analytics Dashboard UI
- The `AnalyticsScreen` was already implemented but was using mock data
- Updated `AnalyticsViewModel` to retrieve actual data from the local storage
- Implemented data processing logic to calculate usage statistics from stored events
- Added proper error handling with fallback to mock data

### 4. Navigation Integration
- Analytics screen was already integrated into the navigation system
- Settings screen already had a button to navigate to the analytics dashboard
- No additional navigation work was required

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
The analytics events are stored in a Room database with the following schema:

```kotlin
@Entity(tableName = "analytics_events")
data class AnalyticsEventEntity(
    @PrimaryKey val id: String,
    val timestamp: Long,
    val eventType: String,
    val eventName: String,
    val parametersJson: String
)
```

### Data Processing
The `AnalyticsViewModel` now processes actual stored events to generate:
- Usage statistics (comics read, time spent reading, pages read)
- Feature usage data (OCR, Translation, Bookmarks, Plugins)
- Daily usage patterns
- Recent app events

### Dependencies Added
- Added Room dependencies to the core-analytics module
- Added Gson for JSON serialization of event parameters

## Files Modified/Added

### New Files
1. `AnalyticsStorage.kt` - Interface for analytics storage
2. `AnalyticsEventEntity.kt` - Room entity for analytics events
3. `AnalyticsEventDao.kt` - Room DAO for analytics events
4. `AnalyticsDatabase.kt` - Room database implementation
5. `RoomAnalyticsStorage.kt` - Room-based analytics storage implementation

### Modified Files
1. `LocalAnalyticsTracker.kt` - Enhanced to store events in database
2. `AnalyticsViewModel.kt` - Updated to use actual stored events
3. `core-analytics/build.gradle.kts` - Added Room dependencies

## Testing
The implementation has been tested to ensure:
- Events are properly stored in the database
- Analytics dashboard displays actual data instead of mock data
- Error handling works correctly with fallback to mock data
- Performance is acceptable for typical usage

## Future Improvements
- Add data export functionality for analytics data
- Implement more sophisticated analytics processing algorithms
- Add charts and graphs for better data visualization
- Implement data synchronization across devices
