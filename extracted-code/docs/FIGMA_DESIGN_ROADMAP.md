# Mr.Comic – Figma Design Roadmap

Comprehensive UI design plan for Mr.Comic app, based on product requirements, XML layouts, and Android constraints. This README describes the design process, tooling strategy, and handoff workflow.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To design a modern, accessible, and scalable comic reading interface using Figma, based on the multi-phase roadmap.

## 📐 Design Architecture
- **Design System**: Color palette (light/dark), typography, spacing, grid
- **Component Library**: Buttons, cards, inputs, modals, FABs, navbars
- **Variants & States**: Loading, empty, error, success, interactive
- **Figma Techniques**:
  - Auto Layout
  - Component nesting
  - Tokens and variables (colors, spacing, font sizes)

## 🧭 Roadmap Overview

### 🔍 Phase 1: Research & Foundation (2 weeks)
- Review existing XML layouts and app architecture
- Create design system and base component library
- Define UX flows for key scenarios

### 📱 Phase 2: Core Screens (3 weeks)
- Home screen (Toolbar, FAB, BottomNav)
- Comic Library (Grid + Filters/Search)
- Comic Reader (Pages, gestures, UI controls)
- Comic Details (metadata, suggestions)

### 🎨 Phase 3: Advanced Editing Tools (4 weeks)
- Image editing panel (crop, rotate, brightness)
- Text editing (OCR blocks, translation UI)
- Page layout editing (panel order, merging)
- Export & publish interface

### 🔌 Phase 4: Plugin System (3 weeks)
- Plugin manager UI (cards, install/remove)
- Integration points in app UI
- Developer templates + theme exchange UI

### ♿ Phase 5: Adaptivity & Accessibility (2 weeks)
- Tablet & foldable layouts
- High contrast, large UI elements
- Reading modes (E-Ink, scroll, zoom)

### 🧪 Phase 6: Prototyping & Handoff (2 weeks)
- Interactive prototypes with animations
- Usability testing + feedback loops
- Final specs, style guide, exportable assets

## 🔧 Tools & Conventions
- Figma Styles: for consistent theming
- Variables: for dark mode, responsive spacing
- Auto Layout: for responsiveness
- Interactive Components: for clickable prototypes
- Versioning: design branches and file history

## 🤝 Developer Handoff
- Export: SVG/PNG assets, XML colors/text styles
- Specs: Measurements, behavior, interaction docs
- Animation: Video walkthroughs or Lottie samples
- Collaboration: Weekly sync with devs

## 🧩 Integration Plan
- Design Tokens → XML (via Figma Tokens plugin)
- Responsive layout → Jetpack Compose guidelines
- Naming convention → Match Android resource IDs

## 📦 Deliverables
- ✅ Complete design system
- ✅ All screen flows
- ✅ Prototypes (basic & advanced scenarios)
- ✅ Dev specs and resources

## 🏁 Timeline
Total: **16 weeks** (parallel tasking possible)
